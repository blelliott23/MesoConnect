# Step 2. Warping the seed, target and atlas into diffusion space

Three Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space images are transformed for each tract: the seed region, the target region and the atlas's 50% binary map. Each passes through the nonlinear warp from Step 1 and then the linear T1 → diffusion transform. Nearest-neighbour interpolation is used at both stages because the images are labels, and the result is re-binarized.

## Procedure

```bash
# MNI -> T1 (ANTs, nonlinear)
antsApplyTransforms -d 3 -i "$ATLAS_MNI" -r "$T1" -o "$d/${TRACT}_atlas_t1.nii.gz" \
  -t "$OUT/$s/reg/mni2t1_1Warp.nii.gz" -t "$OUT/$s/reg/mni2t1_0GenericAffine.mat" -n NearestNeighbor

# T1 -> diffusion (FLIRT, linear); with T1_TO_DWI=header, -usesqform replaces -init <matrix>
flirt -in "$d/${TRACT}_atlas_t1.nii.gz" -ref "$PROJECT/dwi/$s/nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz" \
  -applyxfm -init "$PROJECT/xfm/$s/str2diff.mat" -out "$d/${TRACT}_atlas_diff.nii.gz" -interp nearestneighbour
fslmaths "$d/${TRACT}_atlas_diff.nii.gz" -thr 0.5 -bin "$d/${TRACT}_atlas_diff.nii.gz"
```

Two successive nearest-neighbour resamplings of a binary mask have negligible effect on its extent. If the probabilistic map is required in native space, it should be warped with linear interpolation and thresholded afterwards. The full script follows; it completes in seconds per participant.

## Verification

The script ends with a per-participant table of the voxel counts of the warped seed, target and atlas and of the seed–target overlap, which must be zero; participants with missing outputs are listed as such. Voxel counts far from the sample mean (more than two standard deviations is a useful criterion) indicate a failed registration and call for inspection of that participant. Table 1 gives the counts obtained in the example dataset, as a reference for the sizes to expect at 2 mm resolution.

**Table 1**

*Voxel Counts of Warped Regions in the Example Dataset (N = 57), VTA → Hippocampus*

| Region | Minimum | *M* | Maximum | *SD* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VTA (L / R) | 32 / 34 | 44 / 44 | 56 / 56 | 5.5 / 5.2 |
| Hippocampus (L / R) | 308 / 332 | 395 / 407 | 497 / 493 | 33 / 34 |
| Atlas, 50% (L / R) | 107 / 99 | 126 / 123 | 146 / 149 | 9.9 / 10.6 |

*Note.* VTA = ventral tegmental area; L = left; R = right.

Visual inspection is performed for every participant by overlaying each warped region on the mean *b* = 0 image. Three views are informative: a whole-brain view for gross placement, a magnified view (5×) around the region for voxel-level placement, and an orthogonal render for the record (Figures 1 to 3). The VTA should lie in the ventral midbrain anterior to the red nucleus near the midline and occupy a small number of voxels; placement in the cerebral peduncle, pons or outside the brainstem indicates a failed registration. The hippocampus should follow the medial temporal lobe along the floor of the lateral ventricle; overlap with the ventricle or placement in white matter indicates an error. The atlas should form a narrow corridor from the VTA through the midbrain to the target. A region located in ventricle, white matter or cortex, a region with zero voxels, or a left-hemisphere region on the right returns the participant to Step 1.

For the anterior hippocampus tract the same procedure is repeated with the anterior atlas file; the seed and target regions are shared (Figure 4).
