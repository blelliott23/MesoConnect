# Step 6. Bundle cleaning

Some streamlines within the corridor follow atypical trajectories. Cleaning is performed with `clean_bundle` from pyAFQ (Kruper et al., 2021), which implements the procedure of Yeatman et al. (2012): each streamline is resampled to 100 points, its Mahalanobis distance from the bundle's mean trajectory is computed, and streamlines exceeding a distance threshold or a length threshold are removed iteratively (Table 1).

## Procedure

**Table 1**

*Cleaning Parameters*

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `n_points` | 100 | Resampling prior to comparison. |
| `clean_rounds` | 5 | Maximum iterations; stops earlier when no streamlines are removed. |
| `distance_threshold` | 3 | Streamlines more than 3 *SD* (Mahalanobis) from the bundle centroid are removed. |
| `length_threshold` | 2 | Streamlines longer than the mean length by more than 2 *SD* are removed. |
| `stat` | `mean` | Centroid statistic. |
| `core_only` | 0 | Distance is computed over the full length of each streamline. pyAFQ 3 and later default to the middle 60%; the script sets 0 so that results do not depend on the installed version. |

```python
from AFQ.recognition.cleaning import clean_bundle
cleaned, keep = clean_bundle(sft, n_points=100, clean_rounds=5,
                             distance_threshold=3, length_threshold=2,
                             stat="mean", core_only=0, return_idx=True)
```

The `core_only` argument exists in pyAFQ 3 and later; the script omits it under earlier versions, whose behaviour it reproduces. In pyAFQ 1.3.2 and earlier the function is imported from `AFQ.segmentation`; the script tries both locations.

The full script follows. It requires pyAFQ and DIPY; on older systems `pip` may require the `zipp` package to be upgraded first.

## Retention

With the thresholds in Table 1, cleaning typically retains 25% to 60% of streamlines, several hundred per participant. Figures 1 and 2 present the comparison referred to in Step 4: the cleaned 0.01 bundle is more compact than the uncleaned 0.06 bundle, with length standard deviations of approximately 3.5 to 4.5 mm for cleaned bundles against 5 to 7 mm for either uncleaned condition.

**Figure 1**

*Effect of Cutoff and Cleaning on One Bundle*

![Three-way comparison of cutoff and cleaning](/img/fig_cleaning_comparison.png)

*Note.* Left: cutoff 0.06, uncleaned (1,000 streamlines). Middle: cutoff 0.01, uncleaned (2,500). Right: cutoff 0.01, cleaned (824). One participant, left posterior VTA → hippocampus. VTA = ventral tegmental area.

*Note.* Bars are grouped by pilot participant and hemisphere. Cleaned 0.01 in green.

## Tracts with two bundles

Some tracts reconstruct as two distinct bundles rather than a single bundle with outliers. VTA → hippocampus has a ventral secondary bundle in a subset of participants, and hippocampus → nucleus accumbens → ventral pallidum frequently produces two bundles. Mahalanobis cleaning applied to such a mixture retains the wrong bundle or a blend. The procedure used during atlas construction clusters the streamlines with QuickBundles (Garyfallidis et al., 2012; threshold 5 mm, streamlines resampled to 100 points), cleans the two largest clusters separately, and retains the anatomically correct one after inspection. Setting `QB_SPLIT = True` in the script produces `_cluster1_cleaned.tck` and `_cluster2_cleaned.tck` per participant. The correct cluster is copied to `<tract>_<cutoff>_cleaned.tck` and the script is run again to rebuild the covariate table; the selection should be recorded per participant in the manifest. In the example dataset the corridor and cleaning were sufficient for VTA → hippocampus and the division was not required.

## Verification

The cleaned file must exist and contain more than zero streamlines for every participant. Counts before and after cleaning and the retention percentage are reported; retention below 15% or above 80% warrants inspection. The script also writes `$OUT/nodewise/<tract>_tract_stats.csv`, which holds the streamline count and mean length of each cleaned bundle (`Streamline_count`, `Mean_length_mm`). Both index reconstruction quality, vary across participants, and are entered as covariates in Step 9.
