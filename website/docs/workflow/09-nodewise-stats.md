# Step 9. Group-level inference

Along-tract data can be analysed at three spatial resolutions: the whole tract, quartiles of the tract, and individual nodes (Table 1). The three address different questions, and no single resolution is appropriate for every study. The resolution, or combination of resolutions, should be specified before results are examined, and the same covariates should be used throughout. Where the neurite density index (NDI) is mentioned below, it refers to the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging metric profiled in Step 8; VTA denotes the ventral tegmental area.

**Table 1**

*Three Resolutions for Along-Tract Inference*

| Resolution | Unit of analysis | Question | Correction | Script |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Whole tract | Metric averaged across nodes; one value per participant per tract | Is the metric associated with the outcome; does the association differ between subregional tracts | None within tract; across outcomes as pre-specified | `09a_tract_models.py` |
| Quartiles | Metric averaged within nodes 0–24, 25–49, 50–74, 75–99 | Does the association vary along the tract; is it confined to a segment | False discovery rate (FDR) or maximum-statistic permutation across the four quartiles | `09a_tract_models.py` |
| Nodes | Metric at each of 100 nodes | Where along the tract is the association located | Cluster-extent family-wise error (FWE) by permutation | `09b_nodewise_permutation.R` |

## Whole-tract model

The metric is averaged across all 100 nodes, or across the retained range if end nodes are trimmed (`--trim`), and the outcome is regressed on the averaged metric and the covariates. All variables are standardized, so coefficients are standardized betas. When two subregional tracts share most of their course (posterior and anterior VTA → hippocampus), both are entered in one mixed model with a subregion term, two rows per participant, a random intercept for participant, and each row carrying its own streamline length and count. The outcome × subregion interaction is tested by likelihood ratio; when it does not improve fit, the main effect is reported. In the mixed model the metric is the dependent variable, because each participant contributes one metric value per tract and a single outcome value. This resolution has the greatest power when the effect is distributed along the tract, and it does not localize the effect.

## Quartile model

The same model is fitted with the metric averaged within each quartile. Because adjacent quartiles are correlated, correction across the four should either use the FDR or a maximum-statistic permutation that preserves their dependence. Uniformity along the tract is tested directly by contrasting the seed-end quartile against the target-end quartile with the mean and the difference entered together: when the mean carries the effect and the difference does not differ from zero, the effect is diffuse rather than localized.

Both resolutions are fitted by one script, which reads the analysis files from Step 8b and the covariate list (`COVARIATES`) from the configuration. With one tract it reports the whole-tract and quartile regressions, the FDR-corrected quartile *p* values and the uniformity contrast; with two tracts it adds the mixed model and the likelihood-ratio test of the interaction for every segment.

```bash
source 00_config.sh
python 09a_tract_models.py --metric NDI --outcomes memory_accuracy,memory_bias
python 09a_tract_models.py --metric NDI --outcomes memory_accuracy \
    --tracts l_vta_l_hipp,anterior_l_vta_l_hipp
```

Results are printed and written to `$OUT/analysis/<tract>__<METRIC>__tract_models.csv`, one row per model term, with the columns `model` (`ols`, `uniformity` or `mixed`), `tract`, `segment`, `outcome`, `term`, `n`, `beta`, `statistic`, `p`, `p_fdr` and `interaction_p`.

## Node-wise model

At each node the outcome is regressed on the node's metric and the covariates, and the fit is compared with a reduced model omitting the metric.

```r
full    ~ metric_node + ICV + tract_length + streamline_count + motion + age
reduced ~               ICV + tract_length + streamline_count + motion + age
```

Each node yields a *t* statistic and a parametric *p* value, and adjacent nodes with *p* < .05 form clusters. Family-wise error is controlled at the cluster level with a Freedman–Lane permutation procedure (Freedman & Lane, 1983; Winkler et al., 2014): the residuals of the reduced model are permuted, all 100 nodes are refitted, the largest cluster of each permutation is recorded, and the procedure is repeated 5,000 times. A cluster's *p* value is the proportion of permutations whose largest cluster is at least as long, and a cluster is retained when that value does not exceed .05; the smallest extent that meets this criterion is reported as the extent threshold. The permutations are drawn once from a fixed seed, so results do not depend on the number of cores. Variables are not standardized in this script; the node-wise estimates are in the units of the outcome per unit of the metric.

The script reads the wide analysis file produced in Step 8b and is called once per outcome, tract and metric: `Rscript 09b_nodewise_permutation.R <analysis.csv> <outcome> <METRIC>_ <out_dir> <label>`, with the label written as `<tract>__<metric>__<outcome>`. Covariate column names and the number of permutations are taken from the `COVARIATES` and `N_PERMUTATIONS` settings in the configuration. Outputs per analysis are `_nodewise.csv` (node, estimate, *t*, *p*), `_clusters.csv` and `_summary.csv`; each call requires a few minutes on one core.

```bash
source 00_config.sh
mkdir -p "$OUT/permutation"
for outcome in memory_accuracy memory_bias; do
  Rscript 09b_nodewise_permutation.R "$OUT/analysis/${TRACT}__NDI__analysis.csv" \
    "$outcome" NDI_ "$OUT/permutation" "${TRACT}__NDI__${outcome}"
done
```

This resolution localizes an effect along the tract. Its limitation is that cluster-extent correction detects contiguous runs of supra-threshold nodes; when an effect is uniform along the tract, per-node *t* statistics remain near threshold at every node and the outcome becomes sensitive to small changes in model specification. In that situation node-wise results are descriptive and the whole-tract or quartile model carries the inference.

## Covariates

Covariates comprise intracranial volume (ICV), the mean streamline length and streamline count of the cleaned bundle (written by Step 6), absolute head motion and age. Length and count are tract-specific and index reconstruction quality. Streamline count can be strongly correlated with the metric under test, which reduces the residual variance available to the test. Its inclusion should be decided in advance and both specifications reported.

## Choosing a resolution

A hypothesis about a particular segment of a pathway calls for the quartile or node-wise model. A hypothesis about the pathway as a whole calls for the whole-tract model. Exploratory work is often best served by the whole-tract model for inference with the node-wise profile reported as description. Tests across several metrics, tracts and outcomes accumulate rapidly at any resolution; fixing the analytic hierarchy in advance (primary metric, primary outcome family) is more readily justified than correcting across all tests afterwards.

## Preparing node-wise results for the Explorer

Node-wise outputs are stacked into a single long-format file for the Node-wise Tract Explorer, the browser-based viewer described in the [Explorer section](../explorer).

```bash
python 09c_stack_for_explorer.py "$OUT/permutation"   # writes results_long.csv in that directory
```

The file contains one row per node with the columns `outcome, tract, metric, node, t, p`, together with `hemisphere, N, covariates, extent_threshold, cluster_p` and `passed`.
