# Step 4. Selection of the FOD amplitude cutoff

The fibre orientation distribution (FOD) amplitude cutoff determines the minimum FOD amplitude at which tracking continues. A high cutoff terminates streamlines before they reach the target; a low cutoff, in unconstrained tracking, produces spurious streamlines. The corridor alters this trade-off. With tracking confined to the corridor, a permissive cutoff produces well-formed bundles while consuming far fewer seeds than a conservative cutoff. This behaviour should be verified for each dataset and tract family by a pilot sweep on a small number of participants, followed by tabulation and side-by-side inspection of the reconstructions.

## Cutoff in routine use

The value in routine use with the corridor mask is 0.01, and it is the default in `00_config.sh`. It is the recommended starting value for any tract reconstructed with this workflow; the pilot sweep described below confirms it for a new dataset or tract family and takes under an hour. Table 1 lists the cutoffs that have been used with the atlas.

**Table 1**

*FOD Amplitude Cutoffs in Use*

| Setting | Cutoff | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Corridor workflow, 3 T multi-shell data (example dataset): posterior and anterior ventral tegmental area (VTA) → hippocampus | 0.01 | Value used for the example dataset |
| Corridor workflow, VTA → accumbens (other users of the atlas) | 0.01 | Reported to reconstruct the tract |
| Atlas construction, 7 T: VTA → hippocampus (both pathways) | 0.06 | Value used to build the atlas |
| Atlas construction, 7 T: VTA → amygdala | 0.08 | Value used to build the atlas |
| Atlas construction, 7 T: hippocampus → accumbens → ventral pallidum | 0.04 | Value used to build the atlas |
| Atlas construction, 7 T: VTA → accumbens (both divisions) and ventral pallidum → VTA | 0.03 | Value used to build the atlas |
| Corridor workflow, atlas authors' worked example (inferior VTA → accumbens, 2 mm-dilated 50% corridor, 1,000 streamlines) | 0.05 | Value used in the atlas repository's example |
| MRtrix3 default for FOD-based tracking | 0.05 | For reference |

*Note.* A cutoff of 0.01 is usable only with the corridor's exclusion mask. Without the mask it produces streamlines throughout the brain.

Because lower field strength yields noisier FOD estimates, a cutoff higher than the 7 T values (approximately 0.08) was anticipated for 3 T data. The pilot sweep did not support that expectation: the conservative cutoffs failed to reach the target in several participants, and 0.01 reached it in all of them with about one fifth of the seeds.

## Pilot sweep

The sweep uses five participants, four cutoffs and reduced budgets (`-select 1000`, `-seeds 5000000`); all other parameters match the production run.

```bash
bash 04_tune_cutoff.sh "sub-01 sub-02 sub-03 sub-04 sub-05" "0.1 0.08 0.06 0.01"
```

The script reports streamlines selected, streamlines generated and mean length for each participant and cutoff. `tckgen` generates one streamline per seed, so the number generated is also the number of seeds consumed. Table 2 gives the streamline counts obtained in the example dataset. At 0.1 most runs exhausted the seed budget before reaching the target. At 0.08 some participants reached the target and one stopped at 309. At 0.06 and at 0.01 all runs reached the target; the 0.01 runs consumed approximately one fifth of the seeds (about 415,000 versus 2.1 million or more at 0.06). Reaching the target in every pilot participant is a necessary condition for a cutoff; the reconstructions must also correspond to the tract, which is assessed next.

**Table 2**

*Streamlines Reached by Cutoff in the Pilot Sweep, Posterior VTA → Hippocampus*

| Participant | Hemisphere | 0.1 | 0.08 | 0.06 | 0.01 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | L | 118 | 556 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P1 | R | 30 | 434 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P2 | L | 274 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P2 | R | 165 | 906 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P3 | L | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P3 | R | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P4 | L | 88 | 309 | 1000 | 1000 |
| P4 | R | 731 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 |

*Note.* Target 1,000 streamlines; seed limit 5 million. P1 to P4 = pilot participants; L = left; R = right.

## Side-by-side comparison

For each participant, the tract-density image (TDI) at each cutoff is rendered on the same axial and coronal slices, one column per cutoff. Dice overlap of each cutoff against the most conservative one, the number of TDI voxels, and the mean and standard deviation of streamline length are computed and summarized.

```bash
python 04b_compare_cutoffs.py "sub-01 sub-02 sub-03 sub-04 sub-05" "0.1 0.08 0.06 0.01"
```

The script writes one panel per participant, `cutoff_summary.csv`, and a summary chart (Figures 1 and 2). In the example dataset the two cutoffs traced the same trajectory in both views. The 0.01 reconstruction was somewhat thicker (mean Dice = .66 against 0.06), mean lengths were similar (approximately 44 versus 47 mm), and the length standard deviation was slightly greater at 0.01 (7 versus 6 mm). Bundle cleaning (Step 6) removes the outlying streamlines responsible for the additional thickness; the cleaned 0.01 bundle is more compact than the uncleaned 0.06 bundle, as shown on that page.

**Figure 1**

*Tract-Density Images at Two Cutoffs, Uncleaned*

![Tract-density images at cutoff 0.06 and 0.01](/img/fig_cutoff_comparison.png)

*Note.* Cutoff 0.06 (left) and 0.01 (right) for one participant, left posterior VTA → hippocampus.

**Figure 2**

*Summary Statistics by Cutoff Across the Pilot Participants*

![Summary statistics by cutoff](/img/fig_cutoff_summary.png)

*Note.* Bars are grouped by pilot participant and hemisphere. Left: mean streamline length. Middle: Dice overlap between cutoffs. Right: standard deviation of streamline length.

## Selection criterion

The cutoff selected is the most permissive value that reaches the streamline target in every pilot participant and whose reconstruction matches the conservative reconstruction. In the example dataset this was 0.01, the value in routine use (Table 1). A higher value is warranted only when the 0.01 reconstruction departs from the conservative reconstruction in the side-by-side images, for example by filling the corridor rather than following the tract; the next value in Table 1 (0.06) is then tried. The sweep should be repeated for each tract family, since a cutoff confirmed for VTA → hippocampus is a starting value for other pathways.

## Options not used

Anatomically constrained tractography (ACT) was evaluated during atlas construction and abandoned because the tissue segmentation's white-matter mask was too restrictive relative to the gray-matter mask and tracts did not reconstruct. The `-backtrack` and `-crop_at_gmwmi` options and custom `-angle` and `-step_size` values were left at MRtrix3 defaults. These options should be introduced only in response to a specific, observed failure.
