# Step 5. Corridor-constrained tractography

Tractography is performed with `tckgen` using second-order integration over fibre orientation distributions (iFOD2; Tournier et al., 2010). Seeding is unidirectional from the seed region, the target region is required, and the inverted corridor from Step 3 is supplied as the exclusion mask.

## Procedure

```bash
tckgen "$PROJECT/dwi/$s/wm_fod_norm.mif" "$tck" \
  -algorithm iFOD2 \
  -seed_image "$rois/${TRACT}_seed_diff.nii.gz" -seed_unidirectional \
  -include "$rois/${TRACT}_target_diff.nii.gz" \
  -exclude "$rois/${TRACT}_exclusion_mask.nii.gz" \
  -select 2500 -seeds 25000000 -cutoff 0.01 \
  -minlength 35 -maxlength 65 -stop \
  -nthreads 8 -force
```

Table 1 gives the rationale for each option, and Table 2 the values used per tract family. The script records the number of streamlines selected and the number generated (equal to the number of seeds consumed) per participant in `$OUT/qc/<tract>_tckgen_summary.csv`. The streamline count and mean length that enter the group-level models as covariates are taken from the cleaned bundle in Step 6, because every uncleaned tractogram that reaches the target contains the same number of streamlines. The full script follows. At 3 T with eight threads each participant and hemisphere requires approximately 2 min; 57 participants with both hemispheres required about 4 hr run serially.

**Table 1**

*Tractography Parameters*

| Option | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `-cutoff` | from Step 4 (0.01 in the example dataset) | The corridor permits a low cutoff. |
| `-select` | 2500 | Sufficient for stable profiles and endpoint maps. Streamline count is not a measure of connectivity; participants who stop short are retained. |
| `-seeds` | 25,000,000 | Ceiling on seeding attempts. The default (1,000 × `select`) is sometimes insufficient to reach 2,500. |
| `-minlength`, `-maxlength` | 35, 65 mm | Set for VTA → hippocampus at 7 T. The example dataset retained them at 3 T, with mean lengths of 44 to 47 mm. Set per tract family from pilot lengths. |
| `-seed_unidirectional` | on | Tracking proceeds away from the seed only. |
| `-stop` | on | Tracking terminates on entering the target. |
| gradient table | embedded in the `.mif` | `-fslgrad` is omitted when the FOD image was built from a `.mif` containing gradients. |

*Note.* VTA = ventral tegmental area; FOD = fibre orientation distribution.

**Table 2**

*Parameters by Tract Family*

| Family | Cutoff with the corridor | Cutoff at 7 T (atlas construction) | Length bounds | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VTA → hippocampus, posterior and anterior | 0.01 | 0.06 | 35–65 mm | Used for the example dataset at 3 T. |
| VTA → amygdala | 0.01, confirm by pilot | 0.08 | 27–40 mm at 7 T; confirm by pilot | Shorter tract. |
| VTA → nucleus accumbens, inferior and superior | 0.01 | 0.03 | 8–35 mm at 7 T; confirm by pilot | 0.01 has been used with the corridor by other users of the atlas; the atlas authors' worked example uses 0.05. The inferior pathway was generated with a 7° angle and 0.25 mm step. |
| Ventral pallidum → VTA | 0.01, confirm by pilot | 0.03 | 15–25 mm at 7 T; confirm by pilot | Generated with a 15° angle. |
| Hippocampus → nucleus accumbens → ventral pallidum | 0.01, confirm by pilot | 0.04 | minimum 5 mm at 7 T; confirm by pilot | The accumbens is a required waypoint. Frequently reconstructs as two clusters; see Step 6. |

*Note.* The 7 T values are the atlas-generation settings ([Atlas construction](../atlas/construction), Table 1); the corridor cutoff is the value in routine use with the corridor mask (Step 4).

*Note.* Where a pilot is indicated, the length bounds are taken from the mean lengths reported in the Step 4 summary.

## Verification

The script reports the number of participants reaching the streamline target and, for each participant, the number of streamlines generated. Reaching the target in every participant with a small fraction of the seed ceiling is the expected outcome. A participant reaching a lower count, for example 1,800, is retained; a participant reaching a very low count, for example 50, is reviewed in Step 7.
